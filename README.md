## **To-Do List App (Cloud-based Version with Firebase)**

### **Purpose**
This project transforms the to-do list application into a cloud-based version by utilizing **Firebase** for task storage and user authentication. The app allows users to manage and organize their personal tasks, while securely storing data on the cloud.

---

### **Features**
- **Cloud Storage with Firebase**: Tasks are stored and retrieved from **Firebase Firestore**, ensuring that each user can access only their personal tasks.
- **User Authentication**: **Firebase Authentication** is used to securely manage user accounts and allow users to access their personal task lists.
- **Add/Remove Tasks**: The app allows users to add and remove tasks with no limit (more than 20 tasks per user).
- **Task List Display**: The tasks are displayed using a **RecyclerView**, making the user interface efficient and responsive.
- **User-Specific Task List**: Each user has access only to their personal task list. There is no global list shared among all users.
